## 🚀 What is VenturePulse?

VenturePulse is a **prompt library + CLI orchestrator** that generates McKinsey-quality product viability reports using AI. It analyzes your product idea across 9 critical dimensions, each as a standalone, focused HTML report:

1. **Executive Summary** - Viability scores, verdict, key highlights, recommended next steps
2. **Market Landscape** - Competitors, timing, TAM/SAM/SOM, white space analysis
3. **Technical Feasibility** - Architecture, complexity, AI/low-code implementation, risks  
4. **Competitive Advantage** - Moats, defensibility, competitive scoring matrix
5. **Business Model** - Pricing, unit economics, financial projections, compliance
6. **MVP Roadmap** - Feature prioritization matrix, phased timeline, implementation strategy
7. **Success Metrics** - KPIs across technical/engagement/business dimensions, risk register
8. **Go-to-Market** - ICP analysis, distribution channels, acquisition strategy
9. **Provenance & Metadata** - Analysis transparency, model details, generation timestamp

**The output:** Nine separate, beautifully formatted HTML reports—each independently comprehensive and presentation-ready.

### The VenturePulse Way (10-15 minutes)
- ✅ One command generates 9 comprehensive reports
- ✅ Automated competitive research and market analysis
- ✅ Structured scoring across all viability dimensions
- ✅ Professional formatting ready for stakeholders/investors
- ✅ Costs $0 (free models) to $5 (premium analysis)

**What used to cost thousands in consulting fees now costs the price of a coffee.**

## 💡 How It Works

### The Architecture

**Previous approach (v1.0):** Single mega-prompt → One massive 9-tab HTML page
- ❌ Token limits with complex ideas
- ❌ Inconsistent output quality
- ❌ Harder to regenerate individual sections

**Current approach (v1.5):** Sequential specialized prompts → all focused HTML reports by section
- ✅ Each analysis builds on previous insights
- ✅ More reliable, more detailed outputs
- ✅ Easy to regenerate any individual report
- ✅ Better handling of complex projects

### The Process

1. **You provide:** A markdown/text file describing your product idea (1-3 pages ideal)

2. **VenturePulse orchestrates:**
   - Loads common analysis instructions
   - Sequentially generates 9 specialized reports:
     - Each section calls OpenRouter API with your chosen model
     - Later sections reference insights from earlier reports
     - Each generates its own styled HTML file
   - Creates provenance metadata for transparency

3. **You get:** all comprehensive HTML reports in a timestamped folder

**Total time:** 10-15 minutes (varies by model)
**Total cost:** $0 (free) to $5 (premium)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OPENROUTER_API_KEY not set"
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# For persistence, add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
echo 'export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### "jq command not found"
```bash
# Mac
brew install jq

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install jq

# Linux (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo dnf install jq

# Windows (Git Bash)
# Download from https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/
```

### "curl command not found"
```bash
# Mac (should be pre-installed)
# If missing: xcode-select --install

# Linux
sudo apt-get install curl
```

### "Model not found" or "Invalid model"
- Check model name is exact (case-sensitive)
- Visit https://openrouter.ai/models to verify
- Some models require special access or credits

### Section generation fails or returns errors
- **Check OpenRouter credits:** Visit https://openrouter.ai/credits
- **Try different model:** Some models have rate limits
- **Enable debug mode:** `export VENTUREPULSE_DEBUG=1`
- **Check project file:** Ensure it's readable text/markdown

### Reports look broken or unstyled
- Open in modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Check if HTML file is complete (not truncated)
- Try regenerating the section

### Analysis takes too long
- Expected: 10-15 minutes for 9 reports
- Premium models (Claude) are slower but higher quality
- Try faster model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`

## ❓ FAQ

### How much does it cost to run an analysis?

Depends on the model you choose:

| Model | Cost per Full Analysis |
|-------|----------------------|
| `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` | **$0** (currently free) |
| `deepseek/deepseek-chat` | ~$0.10-0.20 |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | ~$1-2 |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` | ~$3-5 |

**My workflow:** Start with free model ($0) to filter obviously flawed ideas. For promising ideas, use Claude Sonnet 4.5 ($3-5) for investor-ready analysis.

### How long does it take?

- **Currently:** 10-15 minutes (sequential generation of 9 reports)
- **Coming soon:** 3-5 minutes (parallel generation in v1.6)

Time varies by model—faster models complete quicker, premium models are slower but produce better analysis.

### Can I use this for commercial projects?

**Yes!** MIT license allows commercial use. The generated reports are yours to use however you want—pitch investors, share with clients, include in proposals, etc.

### How accurate is the analysis?

VenturePulse provides **strategic insights** based on AI reasoning and training data. It's exceptionally good at:
- ✅ Identifying competitive landscape
- ✅ Spotting risks you might miss
- ✅ Suggesting pricing strategies
- ✅ Structuring your thinking

**However, always:**
- Validate with domain experts
- Conduct your own customer research
- Verify competitive intelligence with primary sources
- Perform financial due diligence

**Think of it as:** A brilliant research assistant and strategic advisor, not a replacement for human judgment. It accelerates your thinking by 10x, but you still need to validate the insights.

### How does it compare to using ChatGPT/Claude directly?

**Using ChatGPT/Claude directly:**
- Generic, surface-level analysis
- Inconsistent structure across conversations
- You have to remember what to ask
- Missing critical dimensions
- No comparative framework
- Takes 2-3 weeks of iterating

**Using VenturePulse:**
- Comprehensive, structured analysis
- Proven framework covering all dimensions
- Automatic competitive research
- Professional formatting
- Takes 10-15 minutes

**The prompts took months to refine.** You're getting battle-tested analysis templates that have been used on 50+ real projects.

### Can I customize the prompts?

**Absolutely!** That's the whole point of open-source. You can:
- Edit existing section prompts in `prompts/sections/`
- Add new sections (e.g., regulatory deep-dive for healthcare)
- Remove sections you don't need
- Adjust scoring criteria
- Change output format

Fork it and make it your own. Share improvements back with the community!

### Why 9 separate HTML files instead of one big report?

**Strategic decision based on real-world use:**

**Advantages of separate files:**
- ✅ Share specific sections with different stakeholders
- ✅ Email just the "Executive Summary" to busy executives
- ✅ Regenerate individual sections without re-running everything
- ✅ Avoid token limit issues with complex projects
- ✅ Better quality—each section gets full AI focus

**Previous version** (one big file with tabs) had truncation issues and less detailed analysis.

**Future version** might include an optional "combined view" while keeping individual files.

### What if my idea is confidential?

**Your data never leaves your machine except for the API call to OpenRouter.** 

- API calls are encrypted (HTTPS)
- OpenRouter doesn't train on your data (per their policy)
- Generated reports are saved locally on your machine
- No telemetry, no tracking, no data collection by VenturePulse

**For extra security:**
- Use a self-hosted LLM (future feature)
- Review and redact your project file before analysis
- Check OpenRouter's privacy policy

### Can I run this offline or with local models?

**Not currently, but planned for v2.0:**
- Ollama integration for fully local analysis
- LM Studio support
- Self-hosted model options

For now, you need internet + OpenRouter API access.

### Why OpenRouter instead of direct API access?

**OpenRouter provides:**
- ✅ Single API key for 100+ models
- ✅ Unified pricing and billing
- ✅ Fallback routing if model is down
- ✅ Automatic load balancing
- ✅ Easy model switching
- ✅ Usage analytics

You *could* modify the scripts to call OpenAI/Anthropic/Google directly, but OpenRouter makes multi-model testing much easier.

### What if the analysis is wrong or misses something?

**AI analysis has limitations:**
- May miss recent market developments (post-training cutoff)
- Can't validate assumptions with real users
- Doesn't have your domain expertise
- May not know niche competitors

**How to use VenturePulse effectively:**
1. **Start:** Generate initial analysis
2. **Validate:** Check competitive research, verify claims
3. **Augment:** Add your domain knowledge and corrections
4. **Iterate:** Regenerate specific sections with more context
5. **Decide:** Use as input to your decision, not the sole factor

It's a **strategic thinking tool**, not a crystal ball.
