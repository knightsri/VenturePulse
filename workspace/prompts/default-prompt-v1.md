# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You MUST respond with ONLY valid HTML code. Your ENTIRE response must be a single, complete HTML document.

**OUTPUT FORMAT RULES:**

- Do NOT wrap your response in markdown code blocks (no ```html or```)
- Do NOT include any explanatory text before or after the HTML
- Do NOT use markdown syntax anywhere in your response
- Your first line must be: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Your last line must be: `</html>`
- Ensure COMPLETE HTML output - do not stop mid-section or mid-sentence
- If approaching token limits, prioritize completing all tabs over adding extra detail

**Example of CORRECT output:**

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
...your full HTML here...
</html>
```

**Example of INCORRECT output:**

```
Here's the analysis:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
...
```

**IMPORTANT:**

1. If you include anything other than pure HTML, the output will fail.
2. Start directly with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and end with `</html>`.
3. Complete ALL 9 tabs before ending the HTML - do not truncate.
4. If content is long, ensure proper closing tags for all sections.
